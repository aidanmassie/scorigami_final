            The NFL began in 1922, with ten teams from four states. The NFL was
            the first professional football league to successfully establish a 
            nationwide presence, after decades of failed attempts. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There are only two teams still in existence from the start of the National
            Football League: the Chicago Bears and the Arizona Cardinals. The Green Bay
            Packers joined the league a year later, holding its place in history as the
            team with the longest continuous operation in the same location.

            In the inaugural season of the NFL, 68.9% of the games were shutouts (which is 
            definitely not good for Scorigami's)! In the second season, we were given the only 
            game in history containing exactly four points scored for one team.
            <br>
            <br>
            In 1940, we were given arguably the most impressive Scorigami of all-time in 
            the league championship. Chicago beat Washington's professional team with a score
            of 73-0. No scorigami has ever come close to being such a high scoring shutout
            through the remaining years of the league.
            <br>
            <br>
            The reason that Scorigami is important in the game of football is because its scoring
            units are extremely awkward. In almost all other sports, points are tallied by one.
            In football, points can be scored in increments of 2, 3, 6, 7, or 8, which is why
            each individual game poses the opportunity to have a unique outcome. In the 1960's, 
            the AFL was merged with the NFL, adding teams to the league to create a total of 32.
            Due to this league merger, Scorigami went off the charts. With more teams, there's more
            games, there's more points being scored, and more Scorigami's being made. However, up until
            1994, the two-point conversion was not a part of the NFL and caused annual rates of Scorigami
            to dramatically increase. Due to the league reintroducing the conversion, they saved the art 
            of Scorigami forever.
